Hello everyone here is a  background removal app built with React - Python on the backend, it uses flash and rembg

## HOW TO START USING THE APP ?

#### Here is a link if you want to test it on [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/UnCor3/rembg-web-app/main) it should auto start if it does not do

```bash
   pip install -r server/requirements.txt
   # then
   npm run dev
```

#### Or you can clone the repo and make sure that you have python 3.10.6 installed,above or below this version may not work

```bash
   pip install -r server/requirements.txt
   # then
   npm run dev
```

### Performance on codesandbox

It may take really long times removing background,if you really want to inspect the project i would say you run it on your local machine

# I appreciate any PR or any kind of support,thank you..
