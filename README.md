# Rembg Web App - remove.io

Hello everyone here is a simple and great background removal app built with React - Python on the backend(flask) and of course rembg

#### First of all i do not know too much of python so if you have better code you can send a PR

## HOW TO START USING THE APP ?

#### Here is a link if you want to test it on [codesandbox](will be added once i publish it) it should auto start if it does not do

```bash
   pip install -r server/requirements.txt
   # then
   npm install
   # then
   npm run dev
```

#### Or you can clone the repo and make sure that you have python 3.10.6 installed,above or below this version may not work (rembg limitation)

```bash
   pip install -r server/requirements.txt
   # then
   npm install
   # then
   npm run dev
```

### Performance on codesandbox

It may take really long times removing background,if you really want to inspect the project i would say you run it on your local machine

### Production

Notice that code has also some sort of production ready env file to test production but fake ssl do not work great it depends on the the browser because some browsers do not allow connection due to fake ssl info,so i would not suggest running npm run serve

# I appreciate any PR or any kind of support,thank you..
